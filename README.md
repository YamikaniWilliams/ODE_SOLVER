ODE Solver

	A collection of Python scripts for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs) using common numerical methods. This project was developed as part of a research project to explore the implementation and application of these solvers.

Features

	Euler's Method: A simple first-order numerical procedure for solving initial value problems for ordinary differential equations.
	Improved Euler Method (Heun's Method): A second-order predictor-corrector method that uses the average of two slopes (at the beginning and end of the interval) to estimate a more accurate solution.
	Runge-Kutta Method (RK4): A more accurate and widely used fourth-order method for approximating solutions. 

Files Included

	`ODE SOLVER.py`: The main Python script containing the implementation of the numerical ODE solvers.
	`ODE SOLVER.pdf`: A PDF document containing the complete Python script content, formatted for documentation and printing.

Getting Started

   Prerequisites
	'Python 3.x'
	The following Python libraries:
		`numpy`
		`matplotlib`

You can install these dependencies using `pip`:

pip install numpy matplotlib

Usage

To use the ODE solver, you can run the ODE SOLVER.py script from your terminal:
	python "ODE SOLVER.py"
